# How to Invite Users to Your Project

## Quick Start Guide

### Step 1: Invite Someone to Your Project

1. Open your project
2. Find the **"Project Members"** section (below the project title)
3. Click the **"Invite Member"** button
4. Enter their email address
5. Click **"Send Invite"**

**Important**: The person must already have an account! If they don't, ask them to sign up first.

### Step 2: They Accept the Invitation

The invited person will:
1. Receive an email with the subject "You're invited to join [Project Name]"
2. Click the **"Accept Invitation"** button in the email
3. Or visit the **"Invitations"** page from the home screen

Once they accept, they become a project member!

### Step 3: Assign Them to Tasks

Now you can assign them to tasks:
1. Go to any task in your project
2. Click the **"Assigned To"** dropdown
3. Select their name from the list

**Note**: Only project members appear in the dropdown!

## What's Changed?

3. User becomes a project member

- **Member Management**: See who's on your team at a glance

## Common Questions

**Q: Can I invite someone who doesn't have an account?**
A: No, they need to sign up first at your app's signup page.

**Q: How long do invitations last?**
A: 7 days. After that, you'll need to send a new invitation.

**Q: Can I cancel an invitation?**
A: Not yet, but the recipient can decline it.

**Q: Why can't I see someone in the dropdown?**
A: They either haven't accepted the invitation yet, or the invitation expired.

**Q: Can I remove someone from a project?**
A: Yes, use the DELETE button in the members section (coming soon).
